Coding Tasks

Write a program for each of the following:

1)	Recursively find all FASTQ files in a directory and report each file name and the percent of sequences in that file that are greater than 30 nucleotides long.

2)	Given a FASTA file with DNA sequences, find 10 most frequent sequences and return the sequence and their counts in the file.

3)	Given a chromosome and coordinates, write a program for looking up its annotation.  Keep in mind you'll be doing this annotation millions of times.
	-	Input: 
		o	Tab-delimited file: Chr<tab>Position
		o	GTF formatted file with genome annotations.
	-	Output: 
		o	Annotated file of gene name that input position overlaps.
	-	Hint: Most of the sequence reads come from a small portion of the genome. Try to use this information to improve performance, if possible.


NOTE:

	-	Keep in mind; we will use the results of these tasks to assess your ability.  This is a chance for you to show off your programming skills and style. 
	-	A Python solution is ideal, as our code-base is primarily in Python.
	-	Sample input files have been provided for each task.
	-	Make sure you understand the file formats (FASTQ, FASTA, GTF) to perform these tasks correctly.
	-	Please make sure each task can run on the command line.
	-	In the spirit of assessing your programming abilities, please avoid using 3rd-party tools to solve these problems (parsers and formatters excluded).
